# MCA 3rd Semester Lab

Welcome to the MCA 3rd Semester Lab repository! This repository contains solutions to various programming problems organized by week. Each week focuses on different concepts and challenges to enhance your programming skills.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into six folders, each corresponding to a week of lab exercises:

- **Week1**
- **Week2**
- **Week3**
- **Week4**
- **Week5**
- **Week6**

Each folder contains multiple problems with specific objectives. Below is a detailed list of the problems tackled in each week.

## Weekly Problems

### Week 1

1. **Problem1**: Write a program to find the product of two user-supplied integers and if the product is equal to or lower than 5000, return the sum of the two numbers.
2. **Problem2**: Write a program to print the sum of the first 10 numbers.
3. **Problem3**: Write a program to iterate through a supplied list of 20 numbers and print only those numbers which are divisible by 5.
4. **Problem4**: Write a program to check if the given number is a palindrome.
5. **Problem5**: Write a program to calculate the cube of all numbers from 1 to a given number.

### Week 2

1. **Problem1**: Write a program to extract each digit from an integer in reverse order.
2. **Problem2**: Write a program to count the total number of digits in a number using a while loop.
3. **Problem3**: Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range.
4. **Problem4**: Write a program to use a loop to find the factorial of a given number.
5. **Problem5**: Write a program to find the sum of digits of a supplied integer.

### Week 3

1. **Problem1**: Write a program to print the following pattern using a for loop:
    ```
    5 4 3 2 1
    4 3 2 1
    3 2 1
    2 1
    1
    ```
2. **Problem2**: Write a program to print the following star pattern using a for loop:
    ```
    *
    * *
    * * *
    * * * *
    * * * * *
    * * * *
    * * *
    * *
    *
    ```
3. **Problem3**: Write a program to print characters from a string which are present at even index numbers.
4. **Problem4**: Write a program to accept a string from the user and display characters that are present at even index numbers.
5. **Problem5**: Write a program to remove characters from a string starting from position `n` to the end and return a new string. Example: `remove_chars("aligarh", 3)` should return `ali`.

### Week 4

1. **Problem1**: Write a program to create a function `cal_sum_sub()` that can accept two variables and calculate both their addition and subtraction. It should return both addition and subtraction in a single return call.
2. **Problem2**: Write a function to return `True` if the first and last number of a given list are the same. Otherwise, return `False`.
3. **Problem3**: Given a list of numbers, write a program to turn every item of the list into its square.
4. **Problem4**: Given two Python lists, write a program to iterate through both lists simultaneously and display items from the first list in the original order and items from the second list in reverse order.
5. **Problem5**: Write a program to count the number of occurrences of the item `50` in the tuple `tp1 = (50, 10, 60, 70, 50)`.

### Week 5

1. **Problem1**: Write a program to generate a 6-digit random secure OTP.
2. **Problem2**: Write a program to pick a random character from a given string supplied by the user.
3. **Problem3**: Write a program to generate a random password that meets the following conditions:
    - Password length must be 10 characters long.
    - It must contain at least 2 uppercase letters, 1 digit, and 1 special symbol.
4. **Problem4**: Given two lists of numbers, write a program to create a new list that contains odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list.
5. **Problem5**: Write a program to create a NumPy array and return an array of odd rows and even columns from the NumPy array.
6. **Problem6**: Write a program to create a NumPy array and sort it based on the following cases:
    - Case 1: Sort the array by the second row.
    - Case 2: Sort the array by the second column.

### Week 6

1. **Problem1**: Write a Python program that inputs two tuples and creates a third that contains all elements of the first followed by all elements of the second. (You may use other data types such as lists to make your program work.)
2. **Problem2**: Write a Python program to create a dictionary with names and phone numbers. The names should act as keys and the phone numbers as values. Then, ask the user for a name and print the corresponding phone number.
3. **Problem3**: Write a Python program with a void function that receives a 4-digit number and calculates the sum of squares of the first 2 digits and the last 2 digits. For example, if `1233` is passed as an argument, the function should calculate `12^2 + 33^2`.
4. **Problem4**: Write a program that inputs a main string and creates an encrypted string by embedding a short symbol-based string after each character. The program should also be able to decrypt the encrypted string.
5. **Problem5**: Write a program to get roll numbers, names, and marks of students of a class (input from the user) and store these details in a file called "Marks.data".
6. **Problem6**: Write a program to accept a string and display the following:
    - Number of uppercase characters
    - Number of lowercase characters
    - Total number of alphabets
    - Number of digits
